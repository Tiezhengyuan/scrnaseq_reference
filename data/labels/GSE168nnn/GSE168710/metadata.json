    "summary": "We explored how the human macrophages response to different inflammatory factors, focusing particularly on the effects of antiviral interferons (IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3), pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, and other mediators like IL-4. Co-cultured fibroblasts were a component in some conditions to generate factors produced by resident stroma. We used a single-cell antibody-based hashing strategy to multiplex samples from different stimulatory conditions in one sequencing run. This macrophage transcriptomic data reveals distinct macrophage activation states and polarizations shaped by different tissue-related inflammatory conditions at single-cell resolution. We further performed an unbiased integration between tissue-level macrophages and this stimulated human blood-derived macrophages, which pinpoint an IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 synergistically driven inflammatory macrophage phenotype expanded in severe COVID-19 lungs and other inflamed disease tissues.",
